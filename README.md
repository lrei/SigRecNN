## Objective
The objective of this project is to present a solution to a simple
learning task. The task chosen was signature recognition and the solution was to
use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). ANN is a computational model that tries
to simulate aspects of biological neural networks. To use an ANN it is necessary
first to design its structure, define how it functions and to train it to
perform the task at hand, in this case, to recognize signatures.
